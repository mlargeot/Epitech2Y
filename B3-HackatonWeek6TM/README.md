The aim of the project, which spanned a week and involved groups of 4, was to create a company directory for 6TM using PHP Symfony for the back-end part of the directory. This project has enhanced my understanding in:
- PHP Symfony / Doctrine
- Creating an API
- Docker utilization (establishing links between the database/API/front-end)
- Database creation (PostgreSQL)
